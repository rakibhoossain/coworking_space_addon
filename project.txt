Odoo EnterpriseOnlineodoo.sh : YES3 usersSummary  This is a self-service coworking space offering a variety of events and meeting rooms. It is a small space with only a few dozen members.

Features to Develop in Odoo Meeting room booking system (for Members and Non-Members) ●Users must be able to check availability and book meeting rooms directly via the website. ●If the user is not a member: ○The booking is confirmed immediately. ○A CRM opportunity is automatically created with the name: “Meeting Room Booking (Non-Member)”. ●If the user is a member (e.g. logged in via the website portal): ○The booking is automatically approved with no additional steps. Suggested tool: Odoo “Rental” module, with some customization. Preferred setup: A single booking interface for both members and non-members.  If needed for simplicity or cost, we’re open to creating separate interfaces.
Event registration system ●Events must be available for online registration. ●For non-members: ○Events are paid and require online payment (via Stripe) to confirm the reservation. ●For members: ○Events are free. ○Ideally, the user should be logged into their member account to skip the payment process. ○If that’s too complex or costly, we’re open to other simpler ways to identify and validate member access. Monthly subscription billing with automated variables Each subscriber must receive a monthly invoice containing:
Required workflow: ●A draft invoice must be automatically generated for each subscriber on the 1st of every month. ●This draft must include pre-filled lines for the fixed subscription and variables. For meeting rooms: ○Either the total number of hours is automatically filled in a single line ○Or one line is added per booking — whichever is more reliable and easier to implement. ●The system must avoid any calculation errors. ○For example, we can generate a Sales Order or confirmation for each room reservation to ensure accuracy. ●After review, the invoice can be validated and sent normally.

Professional standards ●No quick fixes or workarounds (“hacks”). We expect clean, stable, and professional development. Please consult us before doing anything that could compromise long-term stability or code quality. ●We value responsiveness. You can reach us anytime via email or WhatsApp; we always respond quickly ●To keep us informed, we ask for weekly updates in video format: ○A short video (max 5 minutes) using Loom or sent via WhatsApp ○This video should briefly show your progress on the development ●We do not use video calls or phone calls, as they are time-consuming and complicated for our French-speaking team. ●Everything we build together is strictly confidential. You are not allowed to mention our brand, our names, or our clients’ names publicly or in any communication. Budget and expectations We have allocated a budget of €500 for this project, which corresponds to approximately 30 to 35 hours of work. This is a test project. We have many other projects in the pipeline. If this collaboration goes well, you will be offered more work in the future. However, if the project does not meet expectations — for example, if the final tool is unstable, or if there is a significant time overrun — we will not continue the partnership. We are looking for trustworthy, long-term partners who work seriously and professionally. We are not necessarily looking for the cheapest option, but budget remains an important factor. What we expect from you Please send us a clear proposal including the following: 1.Your commitment : Whether you can implement all requested features within a fixed budget or estimated number of hours. 2.Estimated budget : A breakdown of your cost for this project. 3.Simple project timeline : A realistic schedule from start to delivery. 4.Project phases (if needed) : If the project should be divided into steps or milestones, please describe them. 5.Scope breakdown that clearly explain: ■What you will do ■What you expect us to do 6.Your working method and your preferred approach for a project of this type (tools, communication, validation steps, deployment, etc.)
